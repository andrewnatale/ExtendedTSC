# to-do
# for all traakWT and G124I simulations
# RMSD over time - align on pore backing helices
#   - whole selectivity filter w/ upper loops
#   - all strands individually - whole, sf only, upper loop only
# RMSF - CA and avg sidechain heavy atom
#   - along whole traj, but also time windows (~2-5ns?)
# quantify M3/M4 packing (tyr-phe) and M2/M2 angle changes
# revisit flip probability per strand in sf

# repeat for trek1 lowK
